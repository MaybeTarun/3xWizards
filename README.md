🚀 ZkLend – A Decentralized Lending Platform

ZkLend is a decentralized lending platform leveraging zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) and blockchain technology to provide a secure, private, and transparent lending experience.

📌 Why ZkLend?

Traditional lending systems suffer from:
✔️ Centralization – Controlled by financial institutions
✔️ Security Risks – Vulnerable to data breaches
✔️ Lack of Transparency – Hidden fees and unfair interest rates
✔️ Limited Accessibility – Many people lack access to fair credit

💡 Our Solution

ZkLend uses zero-knowledge proofs to enable:
🔹 Private & Secure Data Sharing – Loan applications without exposing sensitive data
🔹 Fair Interest Rates – Decentralized lending ensures no intermediaries
🔹 Transparent Loan Processing – Smart contracts enforce fair credit decisions
🔹 Accessible Credit – Expanding financial services to underserved communities

🛠️ Tech Stack

🔹 Blockchain – Ethereum
🔹 Smart Contracts – Solidity
🔹 Zero-Knowledge Proofs – snarkjs library
🔹 Frontend – React.js / Next.js
🔹 Backend – Node.js / Express

🔗 How It Works

1️⃣ Users Apply for Loans – Without revealing sensitive data
2️⃣ Zero-Knowledge Proofs Verify Eligibility – Ensuring privacy and compliance
3️⃣ Smart Contracts Process Loans – Transparent and fair lending
4️⃣ Borrowers Repay Loans – Secure, on-chain transactions

📖 Smart Contract

The core lending logic is implemented in Solidity and includes:
✔️ Loan Request & Approval
✔️ Zero-Knowledge Proof-Based Verification
✔️ Decentralized Interest Rate Calculation
✔️ Collateral-Based Lending (Upcoming 🚀)
